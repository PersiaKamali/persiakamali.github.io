We consider a recently proposed model to understand the rigidity transition in confluent tissues and we derive the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) equations that describes several types of dynamics of the model in the thermodynamic limit: gradient descent, thermal Langevin noise and active drive. In particular we focus on gradient descent dy- namics and we integrate numerically the corresponding DMFT equations. In this case we show that gradient descent is blind to the zero temperature replica symmetry breaking (RSB) transition point. This means that, even if the Gibbs measure in the zero temper- ature limit displays RSB, this algorithm is able to find its way to a zero energy configu- ration. We include a discussion on possible extensions of the DMFT derivation to study problems rooted in high-dimensional regression and optimization via the square loss function.
